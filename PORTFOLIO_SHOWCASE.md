## 🎯 Interview Talking Points

### "Tell me about a project you're proud of"
"I built a complete hotel management system in 28 days. It includes a public booking website and an admin dashboard with 10 modules. The system manages 28 rooms, handles real-time bookings, generates invoices, and provides analytics. What I'm most proud of is the comprehensive scope - it's not just a booking form, it's a complete business solution that demonstrates both technical skills and business understanding."

### "Describe a technical challenge you overcame"
"While building the room management system, I needed to sync room status across bookings, housekeeping, and the dashboard. I designed a centralized data structure that maps room numbers to their current state, then built functions that update this structure based on booking dates. This approach kept the code maintainable while handling complex business logic."

### "How do you approach learning new technologies?"
"I used the 28-day hotel project to learn full-stack development from scratch. I broke it into weekly goals, learned fundamentals first, then built increasingly complex features. I debugged issues systematically, used documentation effectively, and applied concepts immediately through hands-on building. The result is a production-ready system that proves I can learn and deliver quickly."
